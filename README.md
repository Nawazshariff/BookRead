A Brain Computer Interface provides a new communication channel between

human brain and the computer. This creates a new paradigm for creating an

application. This work presents a framework and architecture that can help

the development of application using BCI. This report shows the experience

in designing and developing an application prototype using BCI framework

and brainwaves. This application involves eye events signals such as eye

blinking. The user can blink their eyes to navigate through pages or to know

the meaning of a particular word. This application can be especially used

for paralyzed patients as a text reader.

The device tested during the course of the project is the Neurosky Mind-
wave Headset, which is an electro-encephalograph (EEG) recording device

available in market. It enables the measuring of brain activity using one

strategically placed dry electrode sensor. Brain activity is recorded non-
invasively and is sufficient to control the application.
